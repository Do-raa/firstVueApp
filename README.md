###about the project
This project is a users app built using Vue.js and a REST API from https://gorest.co.in/. It allows users to view, create, edit, and delete user profiles. The app retrieves user data from the API and displays it in a list format. Users can create, edit or delete existing user profiles. The app also includes form validation and error handling for user inputs. The goal of this project is to demonstrate proficiency in using Vue.js and consuming external APIs to build a functional web application.
